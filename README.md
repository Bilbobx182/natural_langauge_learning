## Introduction

At the point in life of writing this, I had 2 objectives :
- I wanted to both learn Portuguese (albeit Brazilian Portuguese)
- I wanted to do a natural language processing project.


Problem with learning a language is about _being efficient._
There's no point to learn a bunch of information I won't use.
Why not use all the things I will actually use? Well to do that I need to know the words I use most.


### What this project is
A project made to identify the following :
    - Most common words.
    - Most common verbs.
    - Word commonality to most popular words (according to wikipedia).

### What this project _isnt_

It's not a magical catch all that will tell you everything.
It's not a perfect project intended for anything serious.
It's not a project for all platforms of messeages.
